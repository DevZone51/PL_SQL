11. Please have a look into the AWR report (AWR.html) in attachment and let us know what is the problem
that the AWR is highlighting and potential solution.

Upon reviewing the AWR Report, the section 'Top 10 Foreground Events by Total Wait Time' shows the event 'resmgr:cpu quantum' 
consuming 83% of DB Time, which indicates that CPU contention (with only 8 CPUs currently available) is a major performance issue for the database.
Considering this, I would:

a) Review and tune the major SQL statements listed in the 'SQL Statistics' section to minimize CPU impact; and
b) If step (a) is not sufficient, recommend scaling up the server by adding more CPUs."
