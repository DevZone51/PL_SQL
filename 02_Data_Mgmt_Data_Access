2. Your suggestion for table data management and data access considering the application usage, for example, partition...

 A)  Table Partitioning Strategy

Considering that most users will access data by loc (store/warehouse), the best candidate for partitioning is:
Partition by loc (e.g. RANGE) and subpartition by DEPT

- Improve query performance by reducing I/O (partition pruning).
- Improve concurrency by reducing contention.
- Enable easier maintenance, e.g., loading data per location or archiving old snapshots.

CREATE TABLE item_loc_soh_part
  (
     ITEM VARCHAR2(25) NOT NULL ENABLE,
     LOC  NUMBER(10,0) NOT NULL ENABLE,
     DEPT NUMBER(4,0) NOT NULL ENABLE,
     UNIT_COST NUMBER(20,4) NOT NULL ENABLE,
     STOCK_ON_HAND NUMBER(12,4) NOT NULL ENABLE
  )
PARTITION BY RANGE (loc)
  INTERVAL (1)
  SUBPARTITION BY HASH (dept)
  SUBPARTITIONS 8
(
  PARTITION loc_001 VALUES LESS THAN (2),
  PARTITION loc_002 VALUES LESS THAN (3),
  PARTITION loc_003 VALUES LESS THAN (4)
)
;



B) Indexing for Query Speed
with partitioning local indexing  will boost  performance:
Example:
CREATE INDEX idx_loc_dept ON item_loc_soh (loc, dept) LOCAL;
Use local indexes so they align with partitions and improve partition-wise operations.


C) Data Access Control
Considering the assumption that users only access by associated dept we can consider using Virtual Private Database (VPD) or Oracle RLS you
can restrict rows dynamically by user/dept based on users's sys context .


This way, Oracle Virtual Private Database (VPD) enables dynamically add a WHERE clause in any SQL statement that a user executes based
for example in the departament the user is associated based on  table USER_DEPT (item 5).

'dept IN (SELECT dept FROM user_dept WHERE username = SYS_CONTEXT(''USERENV'', ''SESSION_USER''))';
